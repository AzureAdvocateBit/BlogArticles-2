# Using and Understanding REST APIs

People use applications via a _user interface_ or UI; programs use other programs using an _application programming interface_ or API. Most modern applications, especially those in the cloud, have both user and application programming interfaces which make it possible to access the application's data from another program.

While technically anything that allows one program to access another is an API, for the last fifteen years or so there has been an explosion of APIs that work over the Internet following a style called "REST". This article will explain how to use tbese APIs. The actual meaning of "REST" is left for the last section since it's kind of abstract and not very important for using this powerful technology, so feel free to skip it! Instead of theory, this article will begin with practical information on how to put REST APIs to use.

Learning how to call these services allows access to thousands of services from your Power Apps, Power Automate flows, Single-Page Apps, SharePoint Framework web parts, Azure Logic Apps, shell and Power Shell scripts, C# and NodeJS programs, and more.

Here are some examples of REST services to give you an idea of what's possible.

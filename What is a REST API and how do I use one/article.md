REST API's are all the rage these days, but people are often left guessing what they really are and how to use them. This article aims to ease that confusion and provide you with the information you need to make use of this powerful technology.

## What is an API

API stands for "Application Programming Interface"; REST is just the most popular form of API in use on the Internet. Applications provide a "User Interface" (UI) so people can use them; they provide an API so other application programs can use them. Some typical examples are:

 * An application running on a mobile phone obtains information about the user's upcoming travel plans
 * An application running in a web browser (using JavaScript code on a web page) updates a databaase with a new hotel reservation
 * A Power App or Power Automate flow reads a list of files from Microsoft 365's SharePoint Online service
 * An application running on a PC or Mac obtains a weather forecast and displays it somewhere on the screen
 * A shell or PowerShell script sends a notification email to a user informing them if the script succeeded or failed
